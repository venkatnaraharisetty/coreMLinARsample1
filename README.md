# coreMLinARsample1

This project consists of sample iOS application used to recognize objects using **coreML framework** and display object name in AR(Augmented reality) using **ARKit framework**.
I have used Inception V3 pre trained model in this project for object recognition and native iOS ARKit- framework to display names in AR.

The app will open custom camera view by default and once user taps on screen it will capture image based on users tap position and check model to recognize object and gives identifier for the object.
Once object is found it will display the name above the object in AR. 

## Sample flow will be as below:
